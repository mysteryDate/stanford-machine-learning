select order of polynomial fitting

60% training set
20% cross validation (CV)
20% test set

for each order polynomial, train and check on cv set, then use test set to generalize error

high variance:
	- get more training examples
	- try smaller set of features
	- increase λ

high bias:
	- additional features
	- add polynomial features
	- decrease λ
