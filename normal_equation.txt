when n < 1000 use normal equation, otherwise use gradient descent

n is number of features
m is number of trials
X is the (n + 1 by m) matrix of all features for all training data 
y is the (m length vector) result of all training data

theta is a (n + 1) length vector of the best fit

theta = inv[transpose(X)*X]*transpose(x)*y
pinv(X’*X)*X’*y

Non-Invertibility
- Redundant features (length in feet, length in meters)
- Too many features (m <= n) 
	- delete some features, regularization
